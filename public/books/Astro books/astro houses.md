3 => will power, physical house, mental hosue mainly for 8 th house positivity.

8 = age house, suffering.

12th house from any house negate it self. 7th negate 8 th house. 

Also  house what it shows also can be shown by house in front of it.  

Marak:
2nd house lord is biggest marak , 
followed by 7th lord
planets in 2nd house
planets in 7th house

In the context of 8th house, Lagnesh dosh mukt hai. Asc lord doesnt get any dosh. but 5th and 9th can have dosh.

8th house => 9th house is luck bhagya= 8th house negates 9th house

8th house lord- unless lagnesh- doesn't give good results.

8th house lord's another sign, never come in 2, 4,6,10,12 (8thlord never become lord of 2,4,6,10,12)
if 8th house lord is also the lord of 3 or 11 the it is not positive
