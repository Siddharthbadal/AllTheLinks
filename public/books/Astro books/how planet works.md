180 degree means in front of each other =>  but dashaa is very important. whichever planet dasha is running. for example, if x and y are 180 and y dasha is running then we have to handle x. because y is already working for us and x is stopping by so work on x.  if negative impact the improve work on x so it doesnt negatively hit the dasha running planet y.

whichever planet is activated, if it is negatively hitting a house. then work on this planet so it doesn't hurt the house. 

**Simple rule:**
first, if activation planet has a negative hit and Second if activation planet is hitting a house negatively.
