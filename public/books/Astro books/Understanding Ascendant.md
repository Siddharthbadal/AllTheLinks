**Understanding Ascendant**

whichever zodiac SUN is in, first zodiac of the day in that month will be that sign. 
if SUN is in Aries, then for that month first sign of the day during Sunrise will be Aries

24 hours = 360 d
1440 minutes = 360d

1 d = 4 minutes

1 Sign = 30 d

1 sign= 30 d * 4 min = 120 min 

so if at sunrise Aries is at 27, then

30 - 27 = 3 d

3 d 8 4 min = 12 min
mean, 12 min from sunrise arise ascendant will change.

# Ayanamsa  (Ayan + Ansh)

Precession (Arg-gaman)- tilt in front

earth has three rotation:
first on its Axis (Day night) 24 hours approx..
second, around the sun (Year) 365 days approx..
and third, earth beand towards north and rotates from north to south (weather) (26000 years)

Lahiri : 285 AD (50.2791 per year)
KSK: 291 AD (50.2388475 sec per year)
Raman: 297 AD (50.33 sec per year)
during this time North was at 0 degree and south was ate 180 d. till 2017, it has tilt 24 d . And that is why sun enters Aries late.

Two ways of calculation (Gadna)
Tropical year- Sayana - 365.2422 Days

Sideral Year : Nirayana - 356.2563
Diffrence between two is Ayanamsa. 

In tropical Ayanamsa is not considered. as per tropical, sun comes into Aries every year 21st march. 

1 d = 1 day
24 d = 24 Days
21st march (21 days of march) + 24 days = 45 days
march 31 days=45 - 31 = 14 days
14 days after march 31= 14 april
